# SortVisuals
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

This project is all about practicing your concepts of sorting.     

It allows you to drag and drop numbers from list(s) so as to get help in visualizations and practicing at the
same time.  

It works by giving proper feedback messages as user proceeds to sort(places element from place to another).  

Even if you place an element at wrong place then also it continues to work by taking newly(wrong) made list as its initial input.  

To fill list with some elements ,use sidebar.

This side bar produces differnt range of random numbers so as to create a list which is worked upon by the same algorithm which is producing it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
