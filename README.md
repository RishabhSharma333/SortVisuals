This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

# Sort Visuals  

#### This project is all about practicing and hence visualizing various sorting algorithms.It is a single page Web App
     

It allows you to drag and drop numbers from list(s) so as to get help in visualizations and practicing at the
same time.  

It works by giving proper feedback messages as user proceeds to sort(places element from place to another).  

Even if you place an element at wrong place then also it continues to work by taking newly(wrong) made list as its initial input.  

To fill list with some elements ,use sidebar.

This side bar produces different range of random numbers so as to create a list which is worked upon by the same algorithm which is producing it.  


## Here is the preview of its homepage.

 ## It has eight sorting algorithms covered   
     
 ## 1:Bubble Sort  
 
 
 To use Bubble sort ,firstly create some elements using generate button of sidebar.  
 
 Then follow the procedure of placing the elements ,the same way this technique would sort elements.

## Status  
1:Quick sort and Shell sort still to add.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
